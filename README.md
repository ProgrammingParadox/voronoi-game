# IONOROV
(It's... It's "Voronoi" backwards. Aren't we clever?)

Made in Godot with a friend for a game jam. I did most of the main stuff.
Our game was the crowd favorite, but the judges didn't quite understand how we fit the theme (which I think is a little strange, considering that other participants ranked us #2 on theme and #1 overall)

This was both of our first times making a game with any sort of engine.
